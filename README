Hi ALL!!
Thank you for viewing this project.

This project is about making a "A Personal Video Store" application for iPhone and iPad. This must looking like the iTunes Film Store.

The app starts with an animated logo presentation that i've yet done.

> The next STEP is a page where you can find the Featured Video and the New Video category, listenings the selected items.
-- The video are in the server.

>>Every selected item open a new page that listing an image of the video, some description, some other description, and a comments reviews from the users.

I think that it's all at the moment.

For the next time we implements more functions to the application.
